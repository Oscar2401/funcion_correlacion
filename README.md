# Correlation Function.

It are codes in C++ and python for efficiently computing 2-point and 3-point correlation functions.

## Introduction.

In the last decades, the Correlation Functions (CF) have been widely used in Cosmology. These CF provide a rich and abundant information about how matter is distributed in the Universe. In this work, we provide a set of codes written in C++ to calculate 2-point and 3-point correlation functions of galaxy distributions. Also, the codes were parallelized to be run on GPUs.
